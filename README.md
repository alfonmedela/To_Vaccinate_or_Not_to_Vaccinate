# To Vaccinate or Not to Vaccinate: : Itâ€™s not a Question challenge!

**#ZindiWeekendz** hackathon **#top5** solution

## How to replicate solution

Libraries needed:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Torch
- Fastai
- Transformers

Just in case you are not able to run it, I include a requirements.txt with all the dependencies I have installed in the conda environment. You can check the versions there.

Repeat step 1 and 2 for every split (0,1,2,3,4):
1) Run *split_X/main_train.py*
2) Run *split_X/submission.py*

Once all submission files are generated, run *final_submission.py*
